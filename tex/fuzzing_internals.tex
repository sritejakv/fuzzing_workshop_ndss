\section{Extracting Fuzzing Internal Data}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Events for each of the fuzzing internal stage
    \item Associating internal data to power schedule and search strategies
    \item Use the "interestingness" as a means to derive evaluation metrics: why are seeds added back to the seed pool?
    \item Derive new metrics to measure/understand power schedule and search strategies
\end{itemize}
