\section{Representing Fuzzing as Sequence of Events}
\label{sec:fuzzing_events}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Events for each of the fuzzing internal stage
    \item Associating internal data to power schedule and search strategies
    \item Explain different fuzzing events and the type of data that can be captured during each event
    \item Use the "interestingness" as a means to derive evaluation metrics: why are seeds added back to the seed pool?
    \item Derive new metrics to measure/understand power schedule and search strategies
\end{itemize}
