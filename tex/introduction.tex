\begin{itemize}
    \item What is Fuzzing?
    \item Many developments in Fuzzing
    \item No one really understands fuzzing and how its internals work
    \item Most of it are evaluated using bug based or coverage comparison benchmarks
    \item Example from the experiment where just looking at a coverage does not give any meaningful information about the performance of fuzzing internals
    \item Use the "interestingness" as a means to derive evaluation metrics: why are seeds added back to the seed pool?
    \item Explain the example insights on the above example when looked at it from fuzzing internals perspecitve
    \item Why are we doing this research and how it supports the community
    \item Structure of the paper
\end{itemize}
