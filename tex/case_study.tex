\subsection{EcoFuzz}

\ecofuzz \cite{eco_fuzz} modifies both the power schedule and the search strategy on top of \afl \kts{cite!}. 
The authors claim that the search strategy selects next seed based on the reward probability and the power schedule aims at assigning energy based on the estimated number of mutation with the goal to reduce wasted mutations.
