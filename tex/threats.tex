\section{Threats to Validity}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The impact of mutations is not considered as it is lots of data to collect
    \item Only based on AFL-based fuzzers
    \item Approach assumes edge coverage variants only. But, AFL's configuration considers edge coverage to compute interestingness of seeds
\end{itemize}
