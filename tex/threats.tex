\section{Threats to Validity}
\label{sec:threats}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The impact of mutations is not considered as it is lots of data to collect
    \item Only based on AFL-based fuzzers
    \item Approach assumes edge coverage variants only. But, AFL's configuration considers edge coverage to compute interestingness of seeds
    \item We only analyze the performance until one of the fuzzers reach saturation and discard the performance of rest of the fuzzers after the saturation time
\end{itemize}
