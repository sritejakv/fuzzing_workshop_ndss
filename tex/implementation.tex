\section{Implementation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Instrumented different fuzzers
    \item Essentially this approach shall work for any AFL-based fuzzers
    \item All the necessary events must be captured. For ex., energy is extended in AFL++ if a seed is more interesting during the fuzzing campaign.
    \item Fuzzers reach saturation at some point which means there are not more coverage gains seed after this time point. So, in order to enable fair comparison we only consider the latest timepoint in which any of the evaluated fuzzers produce coverage gain as the end time of the fuzzing run. Such an assumption also does not add the unnecessary event sequences during the evaluation.
    \item Configurations of all experiments: fuzzbench, number of trials, trial runtime, etc.
