\section{Implementation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Instrumented different fuzzers
    \item Essentially this approach shall work for any AFL-based fuzzers
    \item All the necessary events must be captured. For ex., energy is extended in AFL++ if a seed is more interesting during the fuzzing campaign.
    \item Configurations of all experiments: fuzzbench, number of trials, trial runtime, etc.
\end{itemize}
